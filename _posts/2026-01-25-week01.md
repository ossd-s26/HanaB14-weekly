## Thoughts for Open Source

To me, open source is an idea about sharing code with the public so that anyone can access it, use it, and even modify it. This kind of sharing helps break monopolies over core technologies and encourages collaboration.
I like to think of open source as an open menu. Everyone can see the recipe, improve the method, and share it with others. People can even open a restaurant and sell the dish, but they must give credit to the original author. In this way, open source supports both creativity and fairness.


## Open Source Project I Use
- Visual Studio Code
- Python
- Eclipse

These tools show how open source software is part of my everyday learning and development workflow.
