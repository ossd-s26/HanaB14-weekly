<!-- Make your blog posts:
Comment on presentations and extensions created by other groups.
What was a biggest take-away from your own group work and from watching other groups.
Comment on the three videos you watched in place of the Wednesday class.
This week you saw several student presentations as well as presentations from OSS conference. Comment on the actual style of presentations - what can you learn from observing presentations made by others? how should your own style of presentation improve based on these observations? -->

## Our first extension
During the past two weeks, my teammate and I built a fun Chrome extension called [MindMelt](https://github.com/ossd-s26/MindMelt-Extension) (you can check our repo and install it!). The whole process was very interesting and helped me understand more clearly how open source projects work in real life. I learned not only how to write code together, but also how to discuss ideas, divide tasks, and solve problems as a team.

This week, different groups presented their extensions. I noticed that every idea, even small ones, can improve user experience. For example, one group designed an extra browser page so users do not need to switch tabs again and again. That idea was simple but very practical. Watching others made me realize that good projects usually start from small daily problems.

My biggest takeaway from our group work and others’ presentations is that open source projects are truly user-centered. The goal is not to show how complex your code is, but to make something useful, clear, and easy for people to use.

## Thoughts on the OSS Summit Videos (North America 2024)
One idea that impressed me most was: **open source is not about building a moat**. This means open source is not about blocking others or protecting ownership. Instead, it is about sharing, collaboration, and growing together. This idea changed how I see software. Before, I thought coding was mostly individual work. Now I see it can also be a global teamwork process.

Another thing I learned from the talks is that many important contributors are not always the most visible ones. Some people fix bugs, review code, or improve documents quietly, but they are essential to the project. This made me understand that contribution is not only about writing big features.

## Presentation Skills Reflection
After watching many presentations, I realized presentation style matters as much as content. Good speakers usually:
- make eye contact  
- speak clearly and slowly  
- show confidence  
- explain ideas step by step  

One key lesson for me is that practice is very important. The groups that practiced more looked more natural and confident. In the future, I want to improve my own presentation style by rehearsing more and focusing on clear explanations instead of too many technical details.

Overall, this week helped me learn not only technical skills, but also teamwork, communication, and presentation skills. These are just as important as coding in real projects.
